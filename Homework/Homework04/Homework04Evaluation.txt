Nice work on this assignment!

Here are a couple of observations and comments:

VERY NICE work on the bubble sorting app.  Nice annotations on the test code
outputs!!  EXCELLENT AND PROFESSIONAL WORK!!

Also nice on the Huffman coding, providing the compression factor!  Another
nice touch.

Everything works really well, except that simon only displays one letter at
a time, instead of displaying the entire string of letters as it is built.
Still it works fine!

progress on the semester so far:

   homework01  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02   92.00% of  5 points =  4.60 points
   homework03  105.71% of  5 points =  5.29 points
   homework04  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
             total homework points = 19.89 out of 20 = 99.45%
                           which is an A-plus

Keep up the good work!
