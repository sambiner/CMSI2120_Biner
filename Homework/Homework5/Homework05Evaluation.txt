EVALUATION COMMENTS:

Nice work on the BinaryHeap and BinaryTree!  I like the second test on the
tree in which you use objects.  Good on ya.... Also like the excellent job
on printing what's happening with the heap.  Very thorough!

The HashApp has a little problem ~ I wasn't able to get it to display any
values or the table contents.  When I enter a 'd' it just gives back a few
blank lines.  The 'size' command works, so the insert and delete methods
work, and 'get' returns the value I asked for.

DigitFolding doesn't *quite* work like I expected, but it's close enough to
what the exercise is looking for.

One thing to remember: the convention [and actually the command line version
of compilation at times] will barf if the file name and the class name and
the constructor name don't start with uppercase letters.  I changed your
file names and so on for you to make them comply with the convention.

progress on the semester so far:

   homework01  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02   92.00% of  5 points =  4.60 points
   homework03  105.71% of  5 points =  5.29 points
   homework04  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework05   91.67% of  5 points =  4.58 points
             total homework points = 24.47 out of 25 = 97.88%
                           which is an A-plus

Nice job on the homework assignments for this semester!  It's been a great
pleasure having you two in class.  :)
